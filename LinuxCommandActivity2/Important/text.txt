If you have any trouble with any of this please reach out as soon
as you can. 

Also let me know if you will be here this 
summer. If you won't be but want this program to continue
let me know how you would feel if I continued to post meetings
online or host them over zoom. 

I apologize for being slow this week, should smooth
out starting next week.
