Just like the last in-meeting challenge you will be using
the commands shown during the presentation.Except this one
might utilize chaining a few of them together.

This is practice for what finding a flag might look like!
Note that a flag in the form of a string of text will look like...

flag<some_code>

If you find them, PM me a message on discord with the codes.
There are 5 flags in this challenge.
One is a challenge I've found in a real CTF.
